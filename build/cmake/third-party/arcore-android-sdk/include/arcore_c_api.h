/// @defgroup concepts Concepts
/// High-Level ARCore concepts.
///
/// @section ownership Object ownership
///
/// ARCore objects fall into two categories:
///
/// - <b>Value types</b> are owned by application. They are created and
///   destroyed using the @c create / @c destroy functions, and are populated by
///   ARCore using functions with @c get in the function name.
///
/// - <b>Reference types</b> are owned by ARCore. A reference is acquired by one
///   of the @c acquire functions.  For each call to the @c acquire function,
///   the application must call the matching @c release function. Note that even
///   if the last reference is released, ARCore may continue to hold a reference
///   to the object at ARCore's discretion.
///
/// Reference types are further split into:
///
/// - <b>Long-lived objects</b>. These objects persist across frames, possibly
///   for the life span of the application or session. Acquire may fail if
///   ARCore is in an incorrect state, e.g. not tracking. Acquire from list
///   always succeeds, as the object already exists.
///
/// - <b>Transient large data</b>. These objects are usually acquired per-frame
///   and are a limited resource. The @c acquire call may fail if the resource
///   is exhausted (too many are currently held), deadline exceeded (the target
///   of the acquire was already released), or the resource is not yet
///   available.
///
/// Note: Lists are value types (owned by application), but can hold references
/// to long-lived objects. This means that the references held by a list are not
/// released until either the list is destroyed, or is re-populated by another
/// api call.
///
/// For example, @c ::ArAnchorList, which is a value type, will hold references
/// to anchors, which are long-lived objects.
///
/// @section spaces Poses and coordinate spaces
///
/// An @c ::ArPose describes an rigid transformation from one coordinate space
/// to another. As provided from all ARCore APIs, poses always describe the
/// transformation from object's local coordinate space to the <b>world
/// coordinate space</b> (see below). That is, poses from ARCore APIs can be
/// thought of as equivalent to OpenGL model matrices.
///
/// The transformation is defined using a quaternion rotation about the origin
/// followed by a translation.
///
/// The coordinate system is right-handed, like OpenGL conventions.
///
/// Translation units are meters.
///
/// @section worldcoordinates World coordinate space
///
/// As ARCore's understanding of the environment changes, it adjusts its model
/// of the world to keep things consistent. When this happens, the numerical
/// location (coordinates) of the camera and anchors can change significantly to
/// maintain appropriate relative positions of the physical locations they
/// represent.
///
/// These changes mean that every frame should be considered to be in a
/// completely unique world coordinate space. The numerical coordinates of
/// anchors and the camera should never be used outside the rendering frame
/// during which they were retrieved. If a position needs to be considered
/// beyond the scope of a single rendering frame, either an anchor should be
/// created or a position relative to a nearby existing anchor should be used.

/// @defgroup shared_types Shared types and enums
/// Shared types and constants.

/// @defgroup utility_functions Utility functions
/// Utility functions for releasing data.

#ifdef __cplusplus
/// @defgroup type_conversions C++ type conversions
/// These functions expose allowable type conversions as C++ helper functions.
/// This avoids having to explicitly @c reinterpret_cast in most cases.
///
/// Note: These functions only change the type of a pointer; they do not change
/// the reference count of the referenced objects.

/// The actual size of the depth image depends on the device and its display
/// aspect ratio. The size of the depth image is typically around 160x120
/// pixels, with higher resolutions up to 640x480 on some devices. These sizes

/// @c ::ArFrame_acquireDepthImage, @c ::ArFrame_acquireRawDepthImage and
/// @c ::ArFrame_acquireRawDepthConfidenceImage will all have the exact same
/// size.
///
/// Optimal depth accuracy occurs between 500 millimeters (50 centimeters) and
/// 5000 millimeters (5 meters) from the camera. Error increases quadratically
/// as distance from the camera increases.
///
/// Depth is primarily estimated using data from the motion of world-facing
/// cameras. As the user moves their device through the environment, 3D depth
/// data is collected and cached, improving the quality of subsequent depth
/// images and reducing the error introduced by camera distance. Depth accuracy
/// and robustness improves if the device has a hardware depth sensor, such as a
/// time-of-flight (ToF) camera.
///
/// Not every raw depth image contains a new depth estimate. Typically there is
/// about 10 updates to the raw depth data per second. The depth images between
/// those updates are a 3D reprojection which transforms each depth pixel into a
/// 3D point in space and renders those 3D points into a new raw depth image
/// based on the current camera pose. This effectively transforms raw depth
/// image data from a previous frame to account for device movement since the
/// depth data was calculated. For some applications it may be important to know
/// whether the raw depth image contains new depth data or is a 3D reprojection
/// (for example, to reduce the runtime cost of 3D reconstruction). To do that,
/// compare the current raw depth image timestamp, obtained via @c
/// ::ArImage_getTimestamp, with the previously recorded raw depth image
/// timestamp. If they are different, the depth image contains new information.
