# Building for Linux

This document describes the process to build Ocean on Linux.

## 1 Prerequisites

* [General prerequisites listed on the main page](README.md)
* Currently some packages will have to be installed using the package manager of your distributions (example commands and package names given below are for Fedora and Ubuntu, but they should be similar for other distributions):
  ```
  # Fedora
  sudo dnf install libX11-devel-1.7.0-9.el9.x86_64 \
      gtk3-devel-3.24.31-2.el9.x86_64 \
      mesa-libGL-devel \
      libgudev-devel \
      xz-devel

  # Ubuntu
  sudo apt-get install libx11-dev libudev-dev liblzma-dev libgl1-mesa-dev libxcb-glx0-dev
  ```

## 2 Building the third-party libraries

To build the required third-party libraries for Ocean, run the following:

```
cd ${OCEAN_DEVELOPMENT_PATH}
./build/cmake/build_thirdparty_linuxunix.sh -c debug,release -l static -b "${HOME}/build_ocean_thirdparty" -i "${HOME}/install_ocean_thirdparty"
```

Change the values for the build config (`-c`), the build directory (`-b`), and the installation directory (`-i`) as required. Once the build is complete, the compiled binaries can be found in `${HOME}/install_ocean_thirdparty/static_Debug` and `.../static_Release`.


## 3 Building Ocean

The easiest way to build all Ocean libraries and apps is by using the provided build scripts. In a terminal, run:

```
cd ${OCEAN_DEVELOPMENT_PATH}
./build/cmake/build_ocean_linuxunix.sh -c debug,release -l static -b "${HOME}/build_ocean" -i "${HOME}/install_ocean" -t "${HOME}/install_ocean_thirdparty"
```

Change the values for the build config (`-c`), the build directory (`-b`), and the installation directory (`-i`) as required. Make sure that the parameter specifying the location of the third-party libraries is the same as installation path from the previous section. Once the build is complete, the compiled binaries can be found in `${HOME}/install_ocean/static_Debug` and `.../static_Release`.
