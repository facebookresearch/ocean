 * The back facing camera of the iOS device is used as tracking input source.<br>
 * The application will visualize a bounding box and a coordinate system in every input frame for which a valid camera pose could be determined.<br>
 * This demo application uses the platform independent FeatureTracker class implementing most of the necessary code.
 * However, this application here is intended for Apple iOS platforms only.
