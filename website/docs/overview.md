The Ocean framework is a large, organized collection of components and libraries for various tasks,
including computer vision, geometry, media handling, networking, and rendering. This page provides
a general overview of Ocean and explains the structure of the code and how that relates to target
names.

## Main Directories

The framework is quite large, encompassing various components organized into main directories. At
the top-level these include:

- `build/` - build configurations for various build systems, for example: Visual Studio, XCode,
  CMake, or Gradle.
- `doc/` - a collection miscellaneous documents.
- `impl/` - contains all the source code; more details below.
- `res/` - contains all the resource files. This is important mostly for building apps.
- `website/` - the location where the source of website that you're reading right now is stored and
  managed.

The `impl/` directory, in particular, is divided into subdirectories, including `application/`,
which holds the source code for test and demo apps, as well as app-specific libraries like native
libraries for Android apps. Another key subdirectory is `ocean/`, containing the source code for
Ocean libraries and GTest executables.

## Code structure And Naming Conventions

The source code is organized in a hierarchical structure of directories and targets grouped by
topic, such as computer vision or rendering. Typically, each directory corresponds to one build
target, with more specialized uses in deeper directories. The naming of build targets matches the
directory name, for example, code in `ocean/cv/detector/qrcodes` belongs to the target
`ocean_cv_detector_qrcodes`.

### Libraries (`impl/ocean`)

The targets for all Ocean libraries begin with `ocean_*` followed by the name of the library,
`ocean_NAME`, for example:

- `ocean_base`
- `ocean_cv`
- `ocean_geometry`
- `ocean_media`
- `ocean_...`

Several main libraries come with sub-libraries which provide specialized functionalities or platform
specific implementations. These sub-libraries have an additional suffix: `ocean_NAME_SUBNAME`, for
example:

- `ocean_cv_advanced`
- `ocean_cv_detector`
- `ocean_cv_detector_qrcodes`
- `ocean_cv_...`
- `ocean_media_avfoundation`
- `ocean_media_...`

This hierarchy or nesting can go down several levels, `ocean_NAME_SUBNAME0_SUBNAME1_...`, depending
on the need of specialization.

Libraries containing unit tests use the fixed prefix `ocean_test_*`. The remainder of that name then
follows the same convention described above. For example:

- `ocean_test_base` - containing tests for `ocean_base`.
- `ocean_test_cv` - containing tests for `ocean_cv`.
- `ocean_test_cv_detector_qrcodes` - containing tests for `ocean_cv_detector_qrcodes`.
- `ocean_test_...`.

A more detailed description of the Ocean libraries will be provided in the next section.

### Applications (`impl/applications`)

Ocean comes with a large number of demo applications showing how to use Ocean and giving good start
points to investigate the code. All demo applications have the same prefix
`application_ocean_demo_`. Additionally, applications may have a suffix identifying the platform
`_ios`, `_osx`, `_android`, `_quest`, etc. For example:

- `application_ocean_demo_media_videopreview_ios` - an iOS app.
- `application_ocean_demo_media_videopreview_osx` - same app but for macOS.
- `application_ocean_demo_tracking_featuretracker_ios`.
- `application_ocean_demo_...`.

All test applications begin with `application_ocean_test_*`. for example:

- `application_ocean_test_base` - application that runs the tests in `ocean_test_base` for
  `ocean_base`,
- `application_ocean_test_cv` - application that runs the tests in `ocean_test_cv` for `ocean_cv`.
- `application_ocean_test_...`.

In both cases above does the remainder of that target name then follow the same convention described
for the libraries above.

It's worth noting that _Ocean tests can be run two different ways_. Either use the type of test
application described above, or run the GTests inside the library directories. The reason to have
both is that the latter is required for the Meta CI systems, while the former allows us developers
to test and debug algorithms more easily using standard debuggers (such as Visual Studio, XCode,
etc.).

The GTests can be identified by the suffix `*_gtest` in their target names. For example:

- `ocean_test_testbase_gtest`
- `ocean_test_testcv_gtest`
- `ocean_test_testdevices_gtest`
- `ocean_test_testgeometry_gtest`
- `ocean_test_...`
