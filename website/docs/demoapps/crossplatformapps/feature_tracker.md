## Description

The Feature Tracker demo application showcases Ocean's capabilities in tracking planar patterns, such as posters or images. The application offers flexibility in its input source, allowing users to select either a webcam or a video/movie file. Additionally, a simple image can be designated as the tracking pattern.

<div class="center-images">
  <img src={require('@site/static/img/docs/demoapps/crossplatformapps/feature_tracker_android.jpg').default} alt="Image: The feature tracker app on android" height="600" className="center-image"/>
</div>

The renowned SIFT image features are used to extract salient points on the tracking pattern (the image). The tracker detects and tracks these points reliably. The area of the tracking pattern is marked by a virtual bounding box that is aligned with the printout. Note the small coordinate system in one corner of the visualization. The red, green, and blue axes represent the `x`, `y`, and `z` axes, respectively. The performance of the tracker is displayed in the upper left corner, measured in milliseconds.

To try this you'll need to print or display the pattern image used above. A copy of it can be found [here](https://github.com/facebookresearch/ocean/blob/main/res/application/ocean/demo/tracking/featuretracker/tropical-island-with-toucans_800x800.jpg).

## Building

<Tabs groupId="target-os" queryString>

  <TabItem value="android" label="Android" default>
    Ensure the [third-party libraries have been built for Android](https://github.com/facebookresearch/ocean/blob/main/building_for_android.md#2-building-the-third-party-libraries) for all of the required Android ABIs. Let's assume the base location for third-party libraries is `${HOME}/install_ocean_thirdparty`, i.e., the Android versions will be located in `${HOME}/install_ocean_thirdparty/android_${ANDROID_ABI}...`.

    ```bash
    # Define this so that Gradle (and CMake) can find the third-party libraries.
    export OCEAN_THIRDPARTY_PATH="${HOME}/install_ocean_thirdparty"

    # Change into the directory with the Gradle config of this project
    cd ${OCEAN_DEVELOPMENT_PATH}/build/gradle/application/ocean/demo/tracking/featuretracker/android

    # In ./app/build.gradle.kts, ensure that only those Android ABIs are enabled for which the corresponding third-party libraries have been built. Otherwise, your build will fail, cf. the [general build instructions](https://github.com/facebookresearch/ocean/blob/main/building_for_android.md#4-building-the-ocean-android-demotest-apps).

    # Build the debug and release APK of this
    ./gradlew assemble

    # Install the desired APK
    adb install app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
    adb install app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk
    ```

    By default, the log output will be displayed on the screen of the phone as well as in the Android logs, which can be displayed using:

    ```bash
    adb logcat -s Ocean
    ```

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="ios" label="iOS">
    Ensure the [third-party libraries have been built for iOS](https://github.com/facebookresearch/ocean/blob/main/building_for_ios.md#2-building-the-third-party-libraries). Then follow the general [setup for building iOS apps using XCode](https://github.com/facebookresearch/ocean/blob/main/building_for_ios.md#4-building-the-ocean-ios-demotest-apps). Once the generation of the XCode project is complete, open it and search for `application_ocean_demo_tracking_featuretracker_ios` in the scheme at the top. Then hit `CMD-R` to build, install, and run the app and follow the instructions.
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="macos" label="macOS">
    Ensure the [third-party libraries have been built for macOS](https://github.com/facebookresearch/ocean/blob/main/building_for_macos.md#2-building-the-third-party-libraries). Then follow the instructions to build the Ocean code base. Let's assume you're building Ocean with the release build config:

    ```bash
    cd ${OCEAN_DEVELOPMENT_PATH}

    # Build the third-party libraries
    ./build/cmake/build_thirdparty_linuxunix.sh -c release -l static -b "${HOME}/build_ocean_thirdparty" -i "${HOME}/install_ocean_thirdparty"

    # Build and install Ocean
    ./build/cmake/build_ocean_linuxunix.sh -c release -l static -b "${HOME}/build_ocean" -i "${HOME}/install_ocean" -t "${HOME}/install_ocean_thirdparty"

    # Execute the demo app (a bundle)
    open ${HOME}/install_ocean/macos_static_Release/bin/application_ocean_demo_tracking_featuretracker_osx.app
    ```

    Alternatively, [generate a XCode project for Ocean](https://github.com/facebookresearch/ocean/blob/main/building_for_macos.md#4-building-the-ocean-ios-demotest-apps) and search for `application_ocean_demo_tracking_featuretracker_osx` in the schemes at the top. Then hit `CMD-R` to build and run the app.
