## Description

The "External Camera" app expands the functionality of Meta's Quest headsets by allowing users to connect and access external USB cameras. When the app is launched, it displays a straightforward menu listing all connected USB cameras, enabling easy identification and selection of the desired device.

Following the selection of a camera, the app seeks permission to access the external USB device, ensuring security and user consent. After permission is granted, users are presented with a menu to select their preferred stream configuration for the video feed, allowing customization based on specific requirements or preferences.

The final step in the setup process is the real-time display of the live camera stream within the Quest environment. This feature not only broadens the capabilities of the Quest headset but also offers numerous possibilities for integrating real-world visuals into VR experiences for monitoring, broadcasting, or interactive purposes.
