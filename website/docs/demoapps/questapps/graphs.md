## Description

The Quest [Graph Visualizer](https://github.com/facebookresearch/ocean/blob/bd9406c9a318ca1b259dded4f2fba89602b2039c/impl/application/ocean/demo/platform/meta/quest/openxr/graphs/quest/GraphsApplication.cpp#L20) is a sophisticated VR application designed to render interactive 3D graphs, offering a dynamic and immersive way to explore mathematical functions and partial derivatives. This app is particularly useful for users interested in visualizing complex mathematical landscapes.

The app presents a menu from which users can select predefined 3D functions, ranging from simple sinusoidal wave functions to more complex shapes like a torus or a hyperbolic surface. Users can select a function using the controllers. Once a menu entry is selected, the mesh of the 3D function is calculated and visualized in front of the user. Users can change the visualization mode, for example, switching from a solid surface to a wireframe mode, or toggling normals on and off ([by clicking the controller buttons](https://github.com/facebookresearch/ocean/blob/964c9f61d12ac9ef9ab429cf808fb0f52007c836/impl/application/ocean/demo/platform/meta/quest/openxr/graphs/quest/GraphsApplication.cpp#L286)). Additionally, after setting the controllers aside, users can visualize a Gradient Descent path at arbitrary locations using simple hand interactions: the left hand points with the index finger to select the intersection point on the surface, while the right hand projects the fingertips onto the function's surface.

Adding a new 3D function for visualization is straightforward â€” simply provide the [function pointer](https://github.com/facebookresearch/ocean/blob/964c9f61d12ac9ef9ab429cf808fb0f52007c836/impl/application/ocean/demo/platform/meta/quest/openxr/graphs/quest/GraphsApplication.cpp#L306) to the new function to be visualized. The app utilizes Ocean's [AutomaticDifferentiation](https://www.internalfb.com/intern/staticdocs/ocean/doxygen/class_ocean_1_1_automatic_differentiation_t.html) functionality to automatically calculate the function values and their partial derivatives.

Furthermore, a custom scale and visualization boundary can be defined for each graph to ensure that only a specific part of the function is visualized. This demo serves as an excellent introduction to Ocean's mathematical capabilities and demonstrates how to customize and adjust 3D meshes for rendering.
