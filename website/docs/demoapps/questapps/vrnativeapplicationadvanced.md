## Description

The VRNativeApplicationAdvanced is an enhanced version of the [VRNativeApplication](vrnativeapplication.md), incorporating several additional functionalities and features for a more interactive VR experience.

### Features
  - **Controller Tracking and Visualization**: Automatic tracking and visualization of controllers.
 - **Hand Tracking and Rendering**: Supports hand tracking and rendering for more natural interactions.
- **Passthrough Activation**: Allows activation of passthrough for mixed reality applications.
- **3D Mesh Loading**: Supports loading of 3D meshes for visualization and interaction, with formats like glTF, obj, and X3D supported.

- **Coordinate System Visualization**: Displays the Quest's world coordinate system with 1-meter long axes in front of the user. Each axis has an own color (red for x-axis, green for y-axis, blue for z-axis).
- **Custom OpenGL ES Engine Integration**: Demonstrates how a custom OpenGL ES engine could be integrated into the rendering pipeline (disabled by default).
